IRM-SA
======

This project contains the adaptation extension part for the jDEECo as well as a simple demonstrator example taken from: [http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/projects/components_and_services/irm-sa/](http://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/projects/components_and_services/irm-sa/)

##Running the demonstrator
To run the demo applcation you need to import the project into your Eclipse workspace and execute the main method from the: irm.test.InvariantTest.

##Expected results
The application is highly randomized and prints out messages whenever a process is executed (see the source code in the irm.test packege for more details).
